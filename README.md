# Parallel Computing for Solving Path-based Traffic Assignment Problems
Code repository for the Computer Science Senior Project "Parallel Computing for Solving Path-based Traffic Assignment Problems".

## Project Structure
- `README.md`: This file
- `./warm_up`: some preparation code for the project
  - `pseudo_code.md`: pseudo code for the column generation algorithm


## Notes
Below are some reminders worth mentioning:
- Data Structure: the project should justify which data structure is used for the implementation
- Future Work: below are some improvements that can be done
  - Shortest path algorithm
  - Frank-Wolfe algorithm direction finding - convex function approximation method
